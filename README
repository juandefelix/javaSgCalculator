THIS WAS MODIFIED==================Class Malt: -Modified the constructor, now it takes 3 parameters: the name, lb, oz-There's only one variable for weight. Removed the instance variables 'ln' and 'oz'-Added getters for 'name' and 'weight'. Made these variables private.-Modified the tests accordingly.Class Recipe:-Modified the call to the variables of malt weight. Now it's called 'getWeight'Things to improveEn SpecificGravityCalculator.java, the listener class MyNextListener is creating an arrayList of malts, called myMalts. We should try to create it later. Maybe we can create jus an array of malts, instead of an arrayList.SecondFrame.java is setting the variables of the malts of the arrayList myMalts. Both 1. and 2. shouldn’t happen. The class Recipe should be created and all the variables set up at once. In order to do that you should:	Modify the constructor of the Recipe. We can try to pass a hash of nameMalt:weight pairs.	Modify the Malt constructor. It shouldn’t have two weight variables (Oz and Lb)We should have a static class that makes all the calculations.
